# Amending a Motion

### What is an amendment?

An amendment is a motion which seeks to alter and improve the original motion. If amendments were not permitted, members would have to accept or reject the whole motion. Amendments give them the chance of improving the motion in the manner they desire. No chair has the right to refuse a legitimate amendment to a motion which is before the meeting, and which has arisen in the ordinary course of business.

### Types of amendments

For purpose of description amendments can be divided into five groups:
1. To add words to the original motion.
2. To delete or remove words from the motion.
3. To delete certain words only, and to substitute certain other words in the motion.
4. To delete practically the whole of the motion and substitute a counter-proposal.
5. To amend an amendment.

All these types of amendments will be discussed in [chapter 6](6_types_of_amendment). This chapter examines the principles which apply to *all* amendments.

### General principles

Because ‘amendment’ is merely another name for an amending motion, an amendment is subject to the same general principles as any other motion. Like an original motion, an amendment must be moved, seconded and discussed in accordance with the procedure outlined in [chapter 4](4_debates). Those who move and second must not have spoken on the original motion. Like every other motion, an amendment falls unless it is seconded, except where the standing orders provide that no seconder is needed – for example, in committee. The mover of an amendment cannot, however, reply to the discussion on their amendment.

### Amendments must be relevant

The basic principle governing all amendments is that they must be directly relevant to the original motion. Amendments which simply mutilate a motion by leaving out words, and thus make the motion appear absurd, are frivolous and not in order. Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether a certain amendment does really amend the motion but, broadly speaking, any amendment which is worded in the affirmative and which offers an *alternative* proposal to the course contained in the original motion is a legitimate amendment. It must, of course, deal directly with the subject matter contained in the original motion.

### Example of an amendment

Thus, for example, the following *original motion* might have been moved: ‘That this branch believes the offer from Acme Engineering Ltd to increase the basic rate by 10 per cent and to reduce working hours by half an hour per week is unacceptable, and calls for strike action to achieve the improvements originally sought’. An *amendment* reading as follows has been moved: ‘Delete all after the words “Acme Engineering Ltd” and substitute: “to reduce working hours by half an hour per week is acceptable, but rejects the proposal to increase the basic rate by only 10 per cent. The branch therefore calls for an overtime ban to come into effect immediately and to operate until an acceptable further offer to improve the basic rate is obtained.”’

Not only is the wording of the amendment very different from the original motion, but the course proposed is a radically different one too. Although very little of the motion remains, the amendment is in order because it is relevant to the subject matter in the original motion.

### Direct negative is not an amendment

A simple direct negative – saying ‘no’ to the original motion and nothing more – is not an amendment. Thus, in the case of the original motion mentioned in the last paragraph, it would not be in order to move an amendment: ‘Delete all after “is” and insert “acceptable”’.

It is not enough for an amendment to refuse to take the action suggested in the motion. It must give reasons, or at least make some show of presenting an alternative course.

### Amendment to a negative motion

Sometimes a motion ‘That no action be taken’ is accepted by the chair. It was explained earlier (link) why such a negative motion is undesirable, but it is frequently moved. If an amendment is moved proposing some definite action as against the negative policy, the chair should accept the amendment because it is not a direct negative. The fact that the amendment proposes to take positive action entitles it to come before the meeting.

### Reasoned amendment

The easiest method of saying ‘no’ to a motion is to vote against it. But although this is true, a good debater can word an amendment in such a manner that, although it proclaims something, it nevertheless prevents an action of a positive nature being taken. This is known as a reasoned amendment.

### Several amendments may be moved

Several amendments may be moved to the same original motion. These must not conflict with the business already decided upon, and must not be substantially the same as any previous motion or amendment. Nor must they be frivolous.

### Amendments to be taken in order

Some people think that the amendment which is handed up to the chair first must be put first, irrespective of the part of the motion with which it deals. This is incorrect. To prevent confusion, it is best for those amendments which deal with the first part of the motion to be put first. Those which deal with the middle should come next, and those which deal with the last part should be put last. If an amendment has been moved and carried to alter a later part of an original motion, no amendment can be moved afterwards to alter an earlier part of the motion. However, this principle needs to be applied with commonsense. Some amendments may seek to change every sentence of a motion; in such cases, the only advice which can be given is that the chair must use their discretion in deciding which to take first.

It is the chair's duty to see that the amendment are put in their proper sequence, *so before permitting debate on the first amendment the chair should ask the meeting whether there are to be any further amendments*. This will also prevent discussion becoming protracted, because members will need to make up their minds early as to whether they wish to move further amendments and give notice accordingly. See [chapter 6](6_types_of_amendment) for an example of how this would work in practice.

### One amendment taken at a time

When an amendment has been moved and seconded, no other amendment may be discussed until that amendment has been disposed of. Otherwise, there would be confusion. The standing orders of some bodies, however, do allow for notice of further amendments to be given while the first amendment is being discussed. But in such circumstances no discussion of further amendments should take place until the first amendment has been put to the vote and disposed of.

### Withdrawal

If the mover of an amendment wishes to withdraw it, the chair must ask the seconder whether they also are willing to allow this. If they are, the members present must be asked whether or not anyone objects to the withdrawal. If no one objects, the chair can permit the amendment to be withdrawn immediately, but if *any* member does object to the withdrawal then the amendment must stand. No application for the withdrawal of an amendment can be entertained once the chair has put the question – in other words, announced that the vote is about to be taken.

### Debate on an amendment

When an amendment is moved and seconded, it raises a separate issue from that raised by the original motion. Consequently, any member may speak on the amendment, even though they have already spoken during the debate on the original motion. But a member who has spoken on the original motion cannot later move or second an amendment to that motion, nor move or second an amendment to any subsequent amendments. The rule is that no person may move or second more than one amendment to the same original motion. When the debate on the first amendment is finished, the mover of the original motion is allowed to reply to the discussion.

### Amendment given precedence over original motion

After the mover of the original motion has replied, the amendment is immediately put to the vote. The important point here is that it is the *amendment* which is put to the vote first, not the original motion. The reason for this is that it raises a secondary issue which ought to be determined before the original motion (which raises the main issue) is dealt with.

### Successful amendment displaces original motion

If the majority vote is against the amendment, it is declared lost and, if it is so desired, a further amendment may be moved. If, on the other hand, there is a majority in favour of the amendment, it is declared carried and displaces the original motion. *No vote is taken on the original motion* because members, by voting for the amendment, have excluded the original motion which then ceases to exist.

### ‘The amended or substantive motion’

When an amendment is carried, it would cause confusion if the successful amendment was referred to as ‘the motion’. It therefore changes its name, and is henceforward called the ‘substantive motion’ or the ‘amended motion’. The chair might refer to it as ‘the motion in its amended form’. It is probably best simple to call it ‘the amended motion’, as this is a clearer term than ‘the substantive motion’.

### Amended motion may itself be amended

Still further motions may be moved to a substantive or amended motion, the procedure being exactly the same as in the case of an amendment to an original motion, except that the mover of the amended motion is not allowed the right of reply. Further amendments are subject to the general restrictions mentioned above. Only one such amendment is considered at a time, and each is put to the vote in its turn. If successful, the further amendment takes the place of the amended motion, in the same way as the latter supplanted the original motion. The victorious further amendment then becomes the *new* amended motion. Finally, it is put to the vote as the new *main question* and, if carried, then becomes a resolution.

### Putting the main question

A common mistake is for chairs to deprive members of the right to vote on the main question by simply reading the original motion and the amendment to the meeting. Whichever is carried, subject to being further amended, is declared to be the resolution. This is wrong. Members may have voted for an amendment not because they approved of it but because it was the lesser of two evils.

For example, a member may want a grant of money made to some organisation, and may move and have seconded that £10 is granted. An amendment is moved to make this £5. Members opposed to any grant at all may vote for the amendment because it is better to waste £5 than £10, not because they approve of the grant. But if the chair then declares the amended motion carried, they will have been made a party to something which they oppose. The proper course is for the chair then to put the amended motion to the vote as the main question: ‘That £5 be granted to…’ and members who are opposed to any grant can vote against this.
 
### Safe procedure on financial motions

On financial motions, a safe method is first to decide the main question as to whether *any* money shall be given. This can be done by moving a motion dealing solely with the *principle* of granting any money or none, without stating the amount; then, if the principle is supported, to deal with the question of amount as a further motion. But this is not always possible, particularly in the case of motions containing several clauses.

### Where should the motion be sent?

The mover of a motion should always make clear to whom the resolution is to be sent, and whether action is being requested or whether it is simply for information as an expression of opinion. In the case of a trade union branch dealing directly with an employer about wages, this will be obvious. In other instances it will be less apparent; for example, a resolution by a local political party about education might be intended for consideration by that party nationally, the local education authority, councillors from that party or the teachers' unions.
