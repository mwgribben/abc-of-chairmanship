# Model Standing Orders

### 1. Quorum

Unless otherwise decided, all meetings shall begin at (00) pm, and end at (00) pm. (00) members shall form a quorum. If within half-an-hour of the time appointed for the meeting to commence, a quorum is not present, the meeting shall be dissolved.

### 2. Order of Business

An Agenda shall be prepared by the chairman and secretary, and shall be circulated to members (00) days in advance of each meeting. All items thereon shall take precedence over all other business. Any member wishing to introduce business for the consideration of the meeting may do so after the business on the Agenda has been completed, but must do so in writing, or may give notice of motion to be discussed at a further meeting.

### 3. Suspension of Standing Orders

In the event of any matter of urgency, however, the chairman may accept a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. The member moving such suspension must clearly statethe nature and urgency of his business, the numbers of the Standing Orders affected, and the length of time (not exceeding 30 minutes) he desires such suspension to last. No suspension shall take place except by a two thirds majority vote of the members present.

### 4. Minutes

The minutes of the previous meeting shall be circulated to members with the agenda. No motion or discussion shall be allowed on the minutes except in regard to their accuracy. After the confirmation of the minutes, they shall be signed by the chairman, and the members shall then be at liberty to ask any questions in regard to matters arising out of them. Such questions shall be allowed for purposes of information only, and no debate on the policy outlined in the minutes shall take place.

### 5. Selection of Speakers

Every member shall stand when speaking, and shall address the chairman as ‘Mr (or Madam) Chairman.’ When more than one member rises to speak, the first to rise shall be given precedence, the decision resting with the chairman, but the member who rose immediately after the first one shall have the right to speak at the close of each member's address.

### 6. Chairman's ruling

If the chairman rises to call a member to order, or for any other purpose connected with the proceedings, the member speaking shall thereon resume his seat, and no other member shall rise until the Chair be resumed. The ruling of the chairman on any question under the Standing Orders, or on points of order or explanation, shall be final, unless challenged by not less than (four) members, and unless two thirds of the members present vote to the contrary.

### 7. Interruption

If any member interrupts another while addressing the meeting, or uses abusive or profane language, or causes disturbance at any of the meetings, and refuses to obey the chairman when called to order, he shall be named by the chairman. He shall thereupon be expelled from the room and shall not be allowed to enter again until an apology satisfactory to the meeting be given.

### 8. Speeches

No member shall be allowed to speak more than once upon any subject before the meeting, unless in committee, or on a point of order, or explanation, except the mover of the Original Motion. But on an amendment being moved, any member, even though he has spoken on the Original Motion, may speak again on the amendment. No member shall speak for more than ten minutes at one time. Members wishing to raise points of order or explanation must first obtain the permission of the chairman, and must rise immediately the alleged breach has occurred. Any member may formally second any motion or amendment and reserve his speech until a later period in the debate.

### 9. Motions and Amendments

The first proposition on any particular subject shall be known as the Original Motion, and all succeeding propositions on that subject shall be called amendments. Every motion or amendment must be moved and seconded by members actually present at the meeting before they can be discussed and, wherever possible, should be in writing. It is permissible for a member to make his speech first and conclude with a motion. When an amendment is moved to an Original Motion, no further amendment shall be discussed until the first amendment is disposed of. (Notice of any further amendment must be given before the first amendment is put to the vote.)

### 10. Substantive motions

If an amendment be carried, it displaces the Original Motion and itself becomes the substantive motion, whereupon any further amendment relating to any portion of the substantive motion may be moved, provided it is consistent with the business and has not been covered by an amendment or motion which has been previously rejected. After the vote on each succeeding amendment has been taken, the surviving proposition shall be put to the vote as the main question, and if carried shall then ebcome a resolution of the meeting.

### 11. Right of Reply

The mover of the Original Motion shall, if no amendment be moved, have the right of reply at the close of the debate upon such motion. When an amendment is moved he shall be entitled to speak thereon in accordance with Standing Order number 8, and at the close of the debate on such amendment shall reply to the discussion, but shall introduce no new matter. The question shall then be put to the vote immediately, and under no circumstances shall any further discussion be allowed once the question has been put from the Chair. The mover of an amendment shall not be entitled to reply.

### 12. Withdrawals or Additions

No motion or amendment which has been accepted by the Chair shall be withdrawn without the unanimous consent of the meeting. Neither shall any addendum or rider be added to a motion which has once been accepted by the Chair without such full consent. Should any member dissent, the addendum must be proposed and seconded, and treated as an ordinary amendment.

### 13. Closing Debate

### 14. Adjournment

### 15. Voting

### 16. Voting in Committee

### 17. Notice of motion

### 18. Rescinding a Resolution

### 19. Amendment of Standing Orders
