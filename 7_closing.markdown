# Chapter Seven
# Closing Debate

It was suggested in [chapter 4](4_debates) that the chair should use their discretion about when to close a debate. The standing orders of some bodies expressly give this power; even where they do not do so, the chair is within their rights to close the debate. But particularly where the discussion has aroused strong feelings, or where a very important decision is to be made, there is a danger that if the chair closes the debate on their own initiative, they may be accused of favouring one side of the case to the detriment of the other.

### Categories of closure motions

In such cases it is preferable for the debate to be closed by means of a motion moved from the body of the meeting. There are three main types: (a) motions which call for an immediate decision on the question of issue; (b) motions which shelve the subject indefinitely; and (c) motions which postpone a decision until a future date. Those in categories (b) and (c) are called ‘dilatory motions’, because they delay matters. Breaking the quorum (mentioned in [chapter 2](2_preparation)) is not regarded as a legitimate method of closing a debate and is therefore not discussed here.

### Members previously speaking may not move closure

These three kinds of motions may be moved at any time, but only by those members who have not previously taken part in the debate on that item. Otherwise a closure motion could be used unfairly by members who had already had their say, but wanted to deprive others from expressing the opposite point of view. Movers have no right of reply, nor (with the exception of a motion for the adjournment) can such motions be amended. They cannot be moved on top of one another.

### Chair may refuse

If a closure motion of any kind has been moved and defeated, no similar motion may be accepted by the chair until the debate on the main question has been allowed to continue for a reasonable time. The chair may refuse to accept a closure motion if it seems to be solely for obstructive purposes, or if they consider it is an abuse of procedure. Alternatively they may put a closure motion without discussion.

## (a) Motion for an immediate decision

### Moving the closure

In cases where a debate appears to be unduly long, or the subject seems to have been fully discussed, anyone who has not already spoken may move ‘That the question be now put.’ This is called the *closure* or simply ‘the vote’. Sometimes a member may say, ‘I move the vote’. Whichever term is used the object is the same. It means that, in the opinion of the mover, the debate has been carried on long enough, and they ask the meeting to agree with them by passing their motion and so ending the discussion.

### When to move the closure

It is in order to move the closure at any time during the debate, but the standing orders of some bodies prescribe that the discussion must have proceeded for a definite length of time. The whole idea of the closure is to facilitate business, but it must be used fairly and not stifle legitimate discussion. The *closure* is not an amendment, but a distinct motion, and *it takes precedence over all other business*. Even though a speaker is addressing a meeting, it is quite in order for a member to move the closure, at which point the speaker must cease speaking.

### How closure is applied

The chair must accept the motion when it has been seconded and they should put it to the meeting immediately. *No discussion* may be allowed on the motion for the closure. If it is carried while the original motion is under debate, the vote on the original motion must be put, *the mover being first given the opportunity to reply to the discussion*. When an amendment is before the meeting and the closure is moved, it applies to that amendment only, and *not to the original motion*. In such cases, if the closure is carried, the amendment is put to the meeting in the manner stated above, but the discussion on the *main question* may then be continued until another member rises and moved, ‘That the vote be now taken on the main question.’ If the motion for the closure is lost, it cannot be again moved until the discussion has been continued for a reasonable time.

## (b) Motion shelving the subject indefinitely

The second type of motion for closing debate is that which gets rid of the subject without a vote being taken on the main question. This can be used when motions are introduced which it is very undesirable to discuss, or on which it would be inadvisable for the meeting to make a decision.

### ‘Next business’

The usual way of doing this is to move ‘The the meeting proceeds to the next business.’ Unlike a closure motion, as it raises a new issue there may be discussion on it (including contributions from those who have already spoken on the original motion), but speeches must be directed to the need for proceeding to the next business and must not wander on to the original motion. However, it is unusual to allow speeches on a motion of ‘next business’.

Next business may be moved at any time, even when an amendment is under consideration, so long as the debate has been going on for a reasonable period. If next business is carried, no vote is taken on the main question, and the meeting proceeds to the next item on the agenda. The undesirable motion, together with its amendments, is thereby shelved, and cannot again be raised during the current meeting, although it can be introduced as a new motion at a later meeting. If the motion for next business is lost, the discussion on the main issue is resumed.

### ‘The previous question’

An alternative way of proposing that a vote should not be taken is to move ‘the previous question’, although the device is rarely used – rightly so, because it is likely to confuse a general audience. The previous question differs from ‘next business’ in that it cannot be moved when an amendment is before the meeting, but only when an original motion is being discussed. A further difference is that if a motion for ‘the previous question’ is lost, then the original motion is put to the vote at once without further discussion; if ‘next business’ is lost, the debate on the motion can continue. ‘The previous question’ should never be used in committee; precedent is strongly against it.

### ‘I move progress’

The expression ’I move progress’ may sometimes be used by members wishing to move next business. Strictly speaking, this is incorrect; the term should really only be used to adjourn debate in committee with the intention of picking up the matter at a future meeting.

## (c) Motion postponing a decision

The third method of disposing of a motion is by means of an adjournment. This may be moved for the same reasons as ‘next business’, or may be put to allow the members a period of time in which to gain more information about the subject under disucssion. The adjournment may be moved for (a) adjourning the debate on a particular subject, or (b) adjourning the meeting as a whole. Either of these motions may be moved at any time, even though an amendment is before the meeting. Where they are moved for the genuine purposes of an adjournment, and not to shelve the question entirely, amendments specifying the date of resumption may be moved to the motion for the adjournment.

### Adjournment of debate

To move the adjournment of debate, a member will say: ‘I move that the debate on this subject be now adjourned.’ They may please themselves whether they specify the date on which the debate shall be resumed, or they may move the adjournment *sine die* (that is, for an indefinite period). *Sine die* in the motion gives the impression that it is a side-tracking device, but of course there may be genuine difficulty in stating an exact date or time.

Discussion may be allowed on a motion for a genuine adjournment of debate (but where it is merely a stalling device it should be put without debate). Such speeches as are permitted may be limited by the standing orders, and only one or two speakers allowed. Nothing approaching a general discussion should be permitted, and speakers must confine themselves to the merits of an adjournment. When speeches are allowed, the mover of the original motion may deal with the arguments advanced for the adjournment. This does not interfere with their right to reply on the main question. If the adjournment is carried, the meeting proceeds to the next item.

If the debate is adjourned to a specified date, a member who has already spoken on the main question cannot speak again when the debate is resumed. Usually, the member who moved the adjournment is allowed the first opportunity of addressing the meeting on the main question when the discussion is resumed.

### Adjournment of meeting

A motion for the adjournment of the meeting is usually moved in the form ‘That the meeting be now adjourned’, although sometimes the motion may be worded ‘That the chair leave the chair’. A motion for the adjournment of the meeting (which does not mention any date) must be put to the vote immediately once it is moved and seconded, and no debate or speeches of any kind should be allowed if its obvious intention is to shelve the business. If the motion is carried, the effect is to dispose of the main question without a vote being taken on it. When the meeting again assembles, the original motion could again be moved, and a new debate be held on it.

If the adjournment of the meeting is moved as a separate motion when there is no other question under discussion, for the genuine purpose of fixing the date of the next meeting, the motion may be discussed or amended in the ordinary way.

### Only one adjournment motion at a time

It is out of order to move adjournment motions one upon another. If a motion ‘That the meeting be adjourned’ had been moved, someone who did not want the *meeting* to end but only the *debate* on a particularly motion, might try to move ‘That the *debate* be adjourned’. This could not be accepted as an amendment, but if the motion for the adjournment of the meeting was defeated, it would be in order, after a reasonable period had elapsed, to move the adjournment of the debate. 

### Reasonable time before further motion

Like motions for the closure and the next business, if an adjournment motion has been lost a further motion for the adjournment may not be moved again until the debate has proceeded for some time. This period may be fixed by the standing orders.
