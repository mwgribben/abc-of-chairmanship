# Notice of Meetings, Quorum and Agenda

## Notice of Meetings

Members of societies should always receive a notice of the meeting requesting them to attend. Voluntary organisations – including political parties, trade unions and community groups – should as far as possible represent the views of all their members, and the best way of achieving this is to ensure that members are encouraged to attend meetings regularly by sending them written notices. This should apply unless there are effective substitutes – for example, by useing notice-boards at the workplace for union branch meetings. To ensure maximum participation by members, at least seven days' notice of meetings should be given, particularly when important issues are to be discussed or elections to be held.

### Notice should set out the agenda

Whenever possible, the notice convening the meeting should set out the agenda: that is, the items of business which are to come before the meetings. To guard against accidentally omitting any item of business from the agenda and to allow for contingencies which may arise after the agenda has been printed, it is advisable to say on the notice summoning the meeting ‘The agenda will *include* the following items’. Then follows the list of items. if this is not done, someone may challenge the right of the meeting, when it is held, to deal with an item which has not been specifically mentioned in the notice. Except in the case of an annual or similar formal conference (where it is desirable to preclude the introduction of ‘surprise’ items), the items ‘Any other business’ should be put on the agenda as an additional safeguard, so that if any item has been left out by accident it can be brought up under this heading. It also enables members to raise matters not on the agenda. Notices convening meetings should as far as possible contain every item on the agenda to enable members to judge for themselves how important it is for them to attend.

Although notices of meetings should wherever possible set out the agenda, they may vary widely in other respects. Some may be brief and formal, simply listing the items to be discussed. Others, as well as setting out the agenda, may give the background to an issue to be discussed at the meeting and encourage members to attend by arousing their interest.

## Preparing for the meetings

### Preparing the agenda

In the case of branch or committee meetings, the agenda is usually prepared by the secretary and submitted to the chairman for his approval. If there is a difference of opinion between the chairman and the secretary as to whether any particular item should be put to a meeting, or on any other point concerning the agenda, it is the secretary's duty to refer the matter to the committee or the body under whose auspices the meeting is taking place. It is then their job to decide the point. Failing this, the full meeting must decide whether the item is to be included in the agenda or not.

### Familiarisation with the issues

The chairman should prepare thoroughly for the meeting by familiarising himself with any papers to be considered and making brief notes about any points which may come up. He should make a point of getting to the meeting place at least 15 minutes before the meeting is due to begin to discuss with the secretary any important issues which are likely to arise, and to familiarise himself with any correspondence which is due to be discussed and which he has not seen in advance. Otherwise he will have to do this while the meeting is in progress, which will mean that he will be unable to give his undivided attention to conducting the meeting properly.

## The Quorum

The standing orders or rules will specify the quorum – the number or proportion of members who must be present to permit business to be transacted at the meeting – and no meeting should be allowed to start until the chairman is sure that a quorum exists. The object of requiring a quorum is to ensure that enough people are present to make the meeting sufficiently representative of the association or body concerned.

### Size of quorum

The rules of societies should make provision for a quorum, either by giving the *actual number* of members required or by stating the *proportion* of members which must be in attendance. In principle, a majority would be ideal because there would then be less chance of decisions running into objections on the grounds that the meeting had not been truly representative. But in practice, participation in most bodies tends to be low and a lower figure is more realistic. There will not usually be provision for a quorum in the case of public meetings called by political parties, local associations, religious or social bodies, or mass meetings of trade unions.

### Time limit for quorum

The important thing for the chairman to keep in mind is that if there is no quorum present at any meeting where a quorum is required by rule or standing order, the meeting should be adjourned to another date. If it proceeds, the business will not be in order and decisions will not be binding upon the members. The standing orders should state the time limit within which the necessary quorum should be present – for example, 15 minutes from the start of the meeting.

### Proceeding in the absence of a quorum

Can anything be done in the absence of a quorum? Common-sense suggests that where routine business would be held up because of the absence of a quorum, and where there is no vital issue at stake, nothing would be lost by those present having an informal talk about matters. There may be some outstanding business which cannot be deferred. If there is no meeting, the officials would have to act on their own initiative and it might be helpful for them to know the views of those present. But in such circumstances the officers would bear the responsibility for any actions taken subsequently, and the chairman would have to make it absolutely clear that because of the absence of a quorum no binding decisions could be taken by those present. No record would appear in the minutes other than the bare announcement that no quorum was present and that the meeting had to be adjourned. If the officers are doubtful about the wisdom of even an informal discussion, the chairman should rule that as there is no quorum present no business can be transacted. The secretary should record this in the minutes.

### Members leaving break up quorum

A quorum is needed not only at the beginning but throughout a meeting. If at any time members leave, and this reduces the numbers below the required quorum, the meeting should be adjourned. Otherwise any business which was transacted afterwards would be out of order. The secretary should tell the chairman if he discovers that there is no quorum, and the chairman should then adjourn the meeting.

### Opening the meeting

Once he is satisfied that there is a quorum, the chairman should ensure that meetings begin punctually by rising promptly at the time for commencement and calling the meeting to order. He may use a mallet for this purpose, but in larger meetings a bell is perhaps a better means of ensuring attention. Making sure the mallet or bell is at hand is the secretary's job, as is providing a carafe of water for the chairman with glasses for him and any visiting speakers.

## Agenda

### Specimen branch agenda

The following is a fairly typical agenda for a trade union branch meeting:
