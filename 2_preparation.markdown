# Notice of Meetings, Quorum and Agenda

## Notice of Meetings

Members of societies should always receive a notice of the meeting requesting them to attend. Voluntary organisations – including political parties, trade unions and community groups – should as far as possible represent the views of all their members, and the best way of achieving this is to ensure that members are encouraged to attend meetings regularly by sending them written notices. This should apply unless there are effective substitutes – for example, by useing notice-boards at the workplace for union branch meetings. To ensure maximum participation by members, at least seven days' notice of meetings should be given, particularly when important issues are to be discussed or elections to be held.

### Notice should set out the agenda

Whenever possible, the notice convening the meeting should set out the agenda: that is, the items of business which are to come before the meetings. To guard against accidentally omitting any item of business from the agenda and to allow for contingencies which may arise after the agenda has been printed, it is advisable to say on the notice summoning the meeting ‘The agenda will *include* the following items’. Then follows the list of items. if this is not done, someone may challenge the right of the meeting, when it is held, to deal with an item which has not been specifically mentioned in the notice. Except in the case of an annual or similar formal conference (where it is desirable to preclude the introduction of ‘surprise’ items), the items ‘Any other business’ should be put on the agenda as an additional safeguard, so that if any item has been left out by accident it can be brought up under this heading. It also enables members to raise matters not on the agenda. Notices convening meetings should as far as possible contain every item on the agenda to enable members to judge for themselves how important it is for them to attend.

Although notices of meetings should wherever possible set out the agenda, they may vary widely in other respects. Some may be brief and formal, simply listing the items to be discussed. Others, as well as setting out the agenda, may give the background to an issue to be discussed at the meeting and encourage members to attend by arousing their interest.
