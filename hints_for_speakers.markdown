# Hints for Speakers

This appendix gives some brief pointers to successful public speaking. It is not a comprehensive guide, and those who want to know more should look at one of the number of books on the subject.

### Preparation

Oratory is a natural gift which few possess. The orator thrives on the emotions they arouse in themselves and those they evoke from their audience. But others can achieve fluency and even eloquence by care and practice. So full preparation – which includes reading as much as possible on the subject – is essential.

### Do I use notes or write the speech out in full?

This will vary. If what you have to say is going to be reported in the press, or every word is important, it may be best to write the speech out in full. Inexperienced or nervous speakers may also find that it helps to write out a speech fairly fully. They might then boil it down into notes but carry the manuscript with them as an insurance, in case they break down and lose the thread of what they are saying.

Using notes can enable talented speakers to construct ideas, allusions and metaphors spontaneously from the very act of speaking. In contrast, unless the speaker has considerable acting talent, a speech which is read may sound mechanical and lifeless. But the notes do need to be carefully prepared. In particular the theme of the speech should be carefully thought out, and all the main points should be written down, or they may be forgotten.

You should use main headings and sub-headings. Notes might look something like this:

> #### Why use notes?
> 1. Avoid loss of sequence
> 2. Close-knit argument
> 3. Guard against omissions
> 4. Memories are faulty

You can expand each of these points in your remarks before passing to the next main heading.

Statistics can make telling points, but too much use of figures can bore or confuse an audience.

Pages should be numbered, or you may lose your place. Many people prefer to make notes on cards which can be held during the speech rather than on sheets of paper.

### Delivery

Don't worry about feeling nervous about speaking in public. Most people do, including some of the best speakers, and the extra adrenalin flowing can add an edge to their performance.

Sip water before you start if your throat is dry, and take a few deep breaths to clear your lungs. Try to speak distinctly and not to mumble. Always use lower tones when starting and try and adjust your voice to the acoustics. If there is a microphone, speak naturally into it – don't shout.

Don't start on a high note or you will go higher still and the voice will crack. If this does happen, pause by taking a drink or looking at your notes. Then start again at a lower level.

If you lose your drift halfway through a sentence, don't worry. Many well known speakers leave sentences unfinished. Keep talking, and the point will probably come back to you.

The hardest thing is to learn to pause, but a pause rightly timed before a word or phrase is a very effective form of emphasis. It also gives you a chance of beginning the next sentence quietly.

You must try to hold the audience throughout your speech.

Look at the audience, not at your notes. Try and talk to sections of it in turn, or concentrate on a particular face for a time, and then another. That way you will be able to see whether they are taking it in. If you find the audience slipping and becoming unsettled, and if you feel you have spoken long enough, finish as quickly as you can.

Try to avoid mannerisms. Gestures should be natural, and it helps to keep the hands free and not in pockets. If you find that any particular gesture is becoming over-used, try and cut it out.

Most people aren't natural comedians. If you are one of the few who can tell a joke or an anecdote, don't overdo it. Keep them brief and, above all, relevant. Sarcasm and irony are dangerous weapons to use and are liable to be misunderstood, so should be used sparingly.
