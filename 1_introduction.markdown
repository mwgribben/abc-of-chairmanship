## Chapter One
# Introduction — The Chairman's Role

This chapter explains some basic terms and looks at how the chairman is elected and at his role.

### Rules of debate
There is no legal code of rules applying to meetings (except in the case of public authorities and limited companies, where the law specifies what can and cannot be done). However, there are certain procedures which are generally adopted and which lay down the methods by which meetings should be conducted. Most of these rules are based upon the rules which govern the conduct of business in the House of Commons. They are usually referred to as ‘the rules of debate’ — that is, customs and practices which are in general use and which do not vary very much from one society or body to another. These rules are fully discussed in chapters 3 to 7.

### Standing orders
But it would be unbusinesslike for any organisation to rely merely upon general customs or practices, even though they might seem well established. Disputes do arise in meetings as to what the general custom is, and every society needs rules for the guidance of its own members. Such rules, or *standing orders*, lay down in detail the manner in which meetings should be conducted, and act as a code of practice which formalises and adapts the rules of debate to suit each society's particular requirements. An example of a code of standing orders, which can be amended to suit a society's particular purposes, is set out in appendix C. The standing orders should make it clear that they themselves can be amended — ideally only at the society's Annual Meetings, and by a two thirds majority.
