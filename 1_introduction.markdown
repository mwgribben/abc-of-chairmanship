# Chapter One
## Introduction — The Chairman's Role

This chapter explains some basic terms and looks at how the chairman is elected and at his role.

#### Rules of debate
There is no legal code of rules applying to meetings (except in the case of public authorities and limited companies, where the law specifies what can and cannot be done). However, there are certain procedures which are generally adopted and which lay down the methods by which meetings should be conducted. Most of these rules are based upon the rules which govern the conduct of business in the House of Commons. They are usually referred to as ‘the rules of debate’ — that is, customs and practices which are in general use and which do not vary very much from one society or body to another. These rules are fully discussed in chapters 3 to 7.

#### Standing orders
But it would be unbusinesslike for any organisation to rely merely upon general customs or practices, even though they might seem well established. Disputes do arise in meetings as to what the general custom is, and every society needs rules for the guidance of its own members. Such rules, or *standing orders*, lay down in detail the manner in which meetings should be conducted, and act as a code of practice which formalises and adapts the rules of debate to suit each society's particular requirements. An example of a code of standing orders, which can be amended to suit a society's particular purposes, is set out in appendix C. The standing orders should make it clear that they themselves can be amended — ideally only at the society's Annual Meeting, and by a two thirds majority.

#### Flexibility
From time to time circumstances may arise which make it necessary for the standing order not to be applied too rigidly, and usually the standing orders themselves provide for their suspensions. This is dealt with more fully later (see chapter 13).

#### Election of chairman — for established bodies
The standing orders usually (but not always) prescribe how the chairman (sometimes called the president) is to be appointed. Where it is not done by standing order, the constitution or rules of the society should lay down the procedure. The chairmen of trade unions and political parties — indeed any bodies which have regular meetings — are usually elected at the annual meetings and officiate for twelve months. In such cases it is only necessary to elect a temporary chairman when the regular chairman and vice‐ or deputy‐chairman are absent.

#### Election of chairman — for special meetings
But there are occasions when people who have never met before as a group are called together for a special purpose and will need to appoint their own chairman. In such cases, the person who has convened the meeting should take charge temporarily and ask for nominations. That individual or some other person present may propose that ‘Christine Lewis shall take the chair.’ Another person will second this, and if there are no other names put forward she will be declared elected. If more than one person is proposed, the names must be put to the vote of the meeting. The individual securing the highest number will be elected. The various procedures for elections are described in chapter 8.
