# About Motions

This chapter, and [chapters 4](4_debates) to [7](7_closing), set out the procedures for dealing with motions and amendments. It may be helpful to refer to [appendix B](charts) which shows these procedures in the form of flow charts.

### Proceeding with the agenda

In dealing with the agenda, the meeting has to adopt certain methods to put on record the actions it proposes to take. This necessitates the moving and seconding of motions and amendments, and all the various points which come under the subject of ‘debate’. It is necessary to have a clear idea of what these methods are, beginning with a discussion of motions.

### Every proposition is a motion

Any proposition or suggestion which is properly put forward at a meeting for consideration and adoption in the manner described below is a motion. No matter by what formal name it may be known, it is really in the strict sense a motion. There are several kinds of motions with different names to describe them. All these types are fully described later. But it is essential to remember that all of them are motions.

Strictly speaking, because a motion should declare or proclaim something, each motion should begin with the work ‘That‘. This practice is followed in Parliament and by local authorities, although it seems to have largely gone out of use elsewhere.

### Motions should propose action

But most motions do not confine themselves simple to declaring a point of view. They also propose some definite action. They will usually make a declaration of principle, and then propose certain methods to carry out that principle. A motion which merely expresses an opinion or a wish is known as a ‘pious’ motion. The wording of a motion should be concise and clear, and should not go over the same ground as a motion which has been moved earlier at the same meeting.

### Negative motions

Motions which are purely negative in character should not be accepted. It is not sufficient for a motion to declare it will *not* do something. It must at least express an opinion, and it is possible to word motions so that although they apparently propose action, they actually produce negative results.

For example, a union branch meeting might have a letter inviting it to send representatives to a conference. A motion might be moved ‘That no action be taken’. Although this is quite a usual form of motion, strictly speaking it is out of order because it is a *negative* motion. A better motion would be: ‘That this meeting is of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by sending representatives to this conference, and declines to do so’.

### Securing a negative results

This places on record the opinion of the meeting and declares the principle that no good purpose would be served by attending. At first sight it may apper to be quite as negative as ‘no action’. But actually it is much more definite as it clearly records the determination of the meeting not to accept the invitation. The motion ‘That no action be taken’ in fact neither rejects nor accepts the invitation, but merely leaves the question in a state of indecision and in theory a motion accepting the invitation could be moved at a subsequent meeting. This could be done without rescinding the motion ‘That no action be taken’. The important thing is to make sure that the motion really does dispose of the matter.

### Motion ‘That the letter lie on table’ or ‘be noted’

Sometimes a motion ‘That the letter lie on the table’ is moved to prevent further action. This is not really effective because, if it is strictly interpreted, it means that the letter should be brought up at *every* subsequent meeting. It simple defers taking action. If the words ‘until called for’ are added to this motion, it even then does not dispose of the question entirely, but merely *suspends* judgement to a future date. At a future meeting any member could move that the letter be then considered. There would be no need to rescind the previous resolution. Unless it is genuinely desired to postpone consideration, it is better to move something definite. A similar point might also sometimes apply to the motion ‘That the letter be noted’, although this is primarily intended to record that the matter has been considered.

### Omnibus motions

Sometimes a motion consists of several clauses, each clause dealing with a separate part of the subject. These motions are called omnibus motions because of their size. Depending on how closely each point is related, it may sometimes be best to treat each point as a separate motion, and to debate this and get it out of the way before proceeding to the next. At big conferences, where there might be many speakers on the subject, such a course would be impracticable. Amendments may be moved to any of the clauses of an omnibus motion.

### Composite motions

One form of omnibus motion is the composite motion. This usually arises at national conferences of unions, the TUC and the Labour Party, when there may be several motions on the agenda dealing with the same subject and appearing to overlap one another. In such cases the movers of the motions will be called together for consultation by a body which is usually the Standing Orders (or Conference Arrangements) Committee. When this is done, the parties can usually agree to one comprehensive motion which, while it may not be identical with any of the several motions originally put forward, nevertheless contains sufficient of the policy of each to meet with general agreement.

This means that the conference has only one motion to consider instead of several, which concentrates the debate on a single motion and avoids reptition. Movers of the separate motions usually arrange amongst themselves who will move the composite motion, and who will second and support it. If agreement cannot be reached among the movers about the form of the composite, any of them may insist that their own motion should be put to the conference separately in its original form.

### Motions should be in writing

The person who puts forward a motion is called the mover of the motion. Sometimes they are called the proposer, but ‘mover’ is the correct term. Although many motions do come up on the spur of the moment and arise perhaps from discussion on correspondence or from what a guest speaker has said, whenever possible the mover should put down the exact wording of their motion in writing before handing it up to the chair. (If the mover can provide copies for all present, that is even better.)

This has a number of advantages. First, when writing out their motion the mover has more time to think out the exact wording they wish to use than when they merely get up and give it verbally. Certainly motions should be written out where an important decision has to be taken, because then every single word in a motion may be important. Again, a motion may sound well enough when first heard, but when examined carefully, errors may be detected that would never have occurred if the mover had taken the precaution to write the motion out. This will enable opponents to pick holes in the mover's argument.

A further advantage of a written motion is that in most cases the secretary will be unable to take down the exact words the mover wants to appear in the motion. Usually they can get the substance only, and there are occassions when *every* word counts. The chair should insist upon a written motion if the subject matter is of vital importance.

### Make sure of the wording when motion not in writing

When a motion is not put in writing but has been taken down in substance by the secretary, the chair should immediately ask the secretary to read the motion. They should then ask the mover whether the wording of the motion as read by the secretary is exactly what the mover intended. This procedure should *always* be carried out; otherwise, after the debate has finished and just as the motion is being read to the meeting before the vote is taken, the mover or seconder may complain that the motion is worded differently from the one they have moved or seconded. They may then want to alter the wording. If this were permitted, people who had opposed the motion could object and there could be an embarrassing situation. Consequently it is best to make sure of the actual wording before any discussion is allowed on the motion.

### Wording cannot be altered without consent of all present

Once a motion has been accepted by the chair, it becomes the property of the meeting. It cannot be withdrawn if even one member dissents, nor can it be altered or amended in any way without the consent of all those present at the meeting. During the discussion on a motion, those responsible for moving it may realise that it is likely to be defeated. They may therefore wish to alter its wording to save it from defeat. If it seems to the chair that most of the members present will be willing to allow an alteration in the wording, even though the substance of the motion will be changed, after reading out the proposed alteration the chair should ask whether any member objects to the revised wording. *Even if only one member objects, the motion must stand*. The correct method by which it should be altered is by means of an amendment moved in the way described in [chapter 5](5_amendments). This does not apply to a trivial alteration, but only to an alteration which affects the policy of the motion.

In cases where dissent is shown to an alteration which is of such a minor character as to make further discussion a waste of time, the chair need not wait for a formal motion. They can simply ask: ‘All those in favour of the alteration’; then ‘All those against’.

But if the matter is one of substance the chair should ask for a formal amendment and must allow discussion if it is demanded. In such a situation, moving an amendment is usually the only satisfactory course because members cannot speak twice on the same motion or an altered motion, but they can speak on an amendment; members who may have supported the original motion, but dislike the motion in its altered form should have the right to say so.

### Agreeing on the substance

In committees or relatively informal meetings, whilst there may be some differences as to the actual wording to be used, the substance of the matter is generally agreed. In such cases the exact wording to be inserted in the minutes is often left to the secretary who, if they know their job, can generally express what is wanted a good deal more accurately than can the mover themselves on the spur of the moment.

### Notice of motion

Members should inform the secretary well in advance of the next meeting that they intend to put forward a motion so that the item can be placed on the agenda and the terms of the motion, especially if it is on an important matter, can be sent to every member. But this does not mean that a member cannot put forward a motion at ordinary periodical meetings, arising out of an item on the agenda or coming under the heading of ‘Any Other Business’.

### Notice of important motions must be in writing

However, ‘Any Other Business’ must not be used to bring forward far-reaching motions. This items is meant to allow the discussion of ordinary routine business. Important motions must never be discussed unless due notice has been given, particularly when it is some major policy matter, a question of altering one of the standing order or when money is involved. In such cases, all the members should be given the opportunity of considering it, and the chair should insist on notice being given.

This is especially important where the funds of the society are concerned. Many bodies have rules that no money other than trivial sums can be granted to outside bodies from the funds unless notice of motion has been given. Furthermore, the notice of motion should state the sum which it is proposed should be granted.

### Notice necessary at special meetings

Committees responsible for organising special meetings will usually not permit motions at all, other than purely formal motions on procedure such as ‘Votes of Thanks’, because the business will be restricted to that for which the meeting was called. If motions are invited, there will be a rigid insistence on notice being given.

### Amending a notice of motion

After a member has given notice of motion they may sometimes want to alter it. If the alteration does not alter the policy of the motion they may do this, but must give reasonable notice to the secretary in writing. If the secretary is told only a few minutes before the meeting commences, they would be justified in refusing to accept the alteration, although in that case the member would still be able to appeal to the members to allow them to alter their notice of motion. If they give them permission by a majority vote, then the alteration may be made. This point also applies to conferences attended by branches. Usually a branch can alter its own motion so long as notice of alteration is given sufficiently early to enable it to be circulated on the final agenda.

### No radical alteration allowed

But permission should never be given to alter a notice of motion, if the suggested alteration would materially change the policy of the motion. Even though the meeting may be willing to give consent, the chair should not allow it. Fresh notice must be given in the ordinary way; otherwise, it would destoy the whole purpose of giving notice of motion.

### Notice of amendment

When the meeting has actually begun the discussion on the motion, anyone other than the mover and seconder may move an amendment in the ordinary way. A few societies insist that notice of amendment must be given in addition to notice of motion, so that both motion and amendment can be circulated to the members before the meeting. Although this is a fair practice, it is rather cumbersome, and is therefore rarely followed unless it is definitely provided for in the rules or standing orders.

### Postponement of motion

The mover of a motion of which notice has been given may, with the consent of the chair, postpone the moving of their motion to a later date than that originally intended.

### First motion called ‘original motion’

The first motion which is brought forward on *any particular subject* is called the *original motion*. This distinguishes it from any amendments, or *amending motions* which may be moved later on that same subject. The chair should always refer to it by this name, not only for the sake of clearness, but to make their members familiar with the term. (But this does not mean that the motion which is dealt with under the first item on the agenda is the one and *only* original motion of the meeting. The agenda may be composed of a dozen separate items. Every *item* has its own separate debate, and consequently its own *original motion*.)

### Motions must be moved and seconded

All motions must be moved and seconded; this principle should be embodied in the standing orders. The person proposing the motion is called the mover, and the person seconding it is called the seconder of the motion. Both mover and seconder must be present to pur forward their motion. Very rarely, and only in the case of small committees, should the principle of having a seconder be dispensed with because it must be seen that an issue has at least some support to prevent the meeting's time being wasted.

### Relevance of motions

The chair is not responsible for the policy of any motion or amendment which may be brought before the meeting, but they must see that they are not outside the scope of the meeting. If it is clear that this is the case, they must decline to accept them, but they should not interpret this too narrowly. Similarly, they must not allow any motion which is clearly illegal, nor one which is frivolous. They cannot refuse a motion or amendment which is otherwise in order merely because they differ from the policy which it expresses. Even though they may think it indiscreet or harmful, they must accept it.
