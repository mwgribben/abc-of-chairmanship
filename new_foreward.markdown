# Web Editor's Foreward

Forty years ago, the editors of this updated text noted the ongoing influence of Walter Citrine's *ABC of Chairmanship* across the union and Labour movement since it's original publication in 1939. Remarkably this has continued into the twenty-first century, and any thorough excavation of the rules and order of most modern organisations of this type will show their basis in Citrine's original standard.

Yet while the influence remains, the broader recognition of this foundational text does not. Unlike it's analogous codes such as Erskine May and Robert's Rules of Order, Citrine's text has not been digitised until now, leaving an intellectual gap in the shared understanding of many younger members. They are left relying on second-hand understanding from experienced officers in their local parties and  unable to challenge or utilise the rules for their own purposes.

The text on this website has been kept almost identical to the print copy it's based on, the fourth edition originally published by the Fabian Society in 1982, with only one major change to note. Despite the assurances of the previous editors, the use of he/him pronouns to refer to every officer and member of the organisations discussed is jarring to modern ears and wrong – it needed to change. I have altered them universally to they/them and revised the text where this could introduce ambiguity. I have also changed the role of ‘Chairman’ to ‘Chair’, including the title of this website, as this is now the more common term in the relevant organisations. However for now I have left the formal style of address as ‘Mr’ or ‘Madam Chair’ until a new gender-neutral standard emerges.
